Todo
----

UI
==
[ ] Should the command be run when the user hits ';', or when the user presses 'Enter'
	without ending the line on a '{' or ','?
[ ] Permit sketch and REPL windows to be present separately, together?
[ ] Give REPL Mode focus, not sketch, when sketch is run
[ ] Handle error and status messages
    [ ] Enable colorization
    [X] Enable printing
[ ] Add syntax colorization
[ ] Update font as soon as user changes it in Preferences window

Usage
=====
[ ] Add in miscellaneous command words specific to REPL Mode:
    [ ] print fn (adds all correct commands executed from the last clear into a fn() function at 
        the bottom of the current sketch)
        [X] implement print, ensuring only 1 argument is provided
        [ ] ensure argument is a valid function name
        [ ] print either as last function in file, or as last function in class
    [ ] license
    [X] clear
        [X] Ensure that init properties are copied over when clear is done
    [X] init w h renderer (which serves as a replacement to size(w,h,renderer))
        [X] prevent size() from being called directly
        [X] allow init to be called again, it signifying starting completely from scratch
        [X] allow 3 types of calls:
            [X] init
            [X] init w h
            [X] init w h renderer
    [X] reinit w h renderer (which is effectively like making the sketch larger in size 
        without changing any of the already existing commands)
        [X] allow 3 types of calls:
            [X] reinit
            [X] reinit w h
            [X] reinit w h renderer
        [X] Rename reinit with the brand new, ultra-creative name "resize" :/
            Now how on earth didn't I think of that before...
    [X] undo x (undo the last x non-undo/redo statements)
    [X] redo x (redo the last y undos, y = min(x,k), k=no. of continuous undos before this redo)
    [X] help
    [X] man
[ ] Allow import statements
    [ ] This would include handling PDF in init
[ ] Allow user to copy text immediately via Ctrl+C

Internals
=========
[ ] Error checking
    [ ] Have errors checked line-by-line when blocks of code are entered
    [ ] Throw a list of all errors in each line
    [X] implement basic error checking
[ ] Delete temporary folder used by REPL Mode on exit

Readme
======
[ ] Add a license file

Code Style
==========
[ ] Look at methods such as REPLEditor/handleREPLLaunch and REPLRunner/build and find the best
    place for them
[ ] Check out how enter and delete keys are handled in CommandPromptPane class
[ ] Check out where best to handle the `clear` command actually clearing the console

Done
----

UI
==
[X] Get enter key to run whole command, not break it up
[X] Close REPL sketch when PDE is closed
[X] Get up and down to cycle through the commands
[X] Replace ">> " with "...  " when user enters an incomplete command (Eg: With a '{' or ',' at the end)
[X] Give REPL Console focus when REPL tab is clicked
[X] Get the REPL prompt to have a, well, prompt-like feel

Build
=====
[X] Make things compatible with 3.0

Usage
=====
[X] Add in simple drawing functions
[X] Add in more complex constructs, like variable declarations, ifs and loops
[X] Should clear just clear the console? And the user use init when the sketch needs to be cleared?

Bugs
====
[X] JavaMode errors don't work. Oh oh :O
[X] Arrow keys don't move right after clear is run
[X] Uncaught exceptions (probably, even hopefully) run amok
[X] REPL sketch sometimes just doesn't open, especially just after PDE is started
[X] shift+home>backspace doesn't work, while shift+(home>right arrow)>backspace does- 
    offset error probably?

Readme
======
[X] Add build instructions
[X] Add usage instructions

Code Style
==========
[X] Refactor the code. All of it.
    [X] Remove the dozen-odd test functions and functions no longer in use
    [X] There was a now unused class in there. Remove it after ensuring it is, indeed, unused.
    [X] Remove all the junk commented out code.

Internals
=========
[X] Hot-swap without re-opening new sketches
[X] Use a noLoop() ?
