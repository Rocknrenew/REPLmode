[ ] Get up and down to cycle through the commands
[ ] Make things compatible with 3.0
[ ] Add in simple drawing functions
[ ] Add in miscellaneous command words specific to REPL Mode, such as clear, init x y (which serves as a replacement to size(x,y)), print (which maybe adds in all the code the user has executed from the last clear into an repl() function at the bottom of the current sketch)
[ ] Add in more complex constructs, like variable declarations and loops
[ ] Add colorization
[ ] Update font as soon as user changes it in Preferences window

Done
