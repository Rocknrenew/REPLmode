Todo
----

UI
==
[ ] Should the command be run when the user hits ';', or when the user presses 'Enter'
	without ending the line on a '{' or ','?
[ ] Give REPL Mode focus, not sketch, when sketch is run
[ ] Handle error and status messages
    [ ] Enable printing
    [ ] Enable colorization
[ ] Add syntax colorization
[ ] Update font as soon as user changes it in Preferences window

Usage
=====
[ ] Add in simple drawing functions
[ ] Add in miscellaneous command words specific to REPL Mode:
    [ ] clear
    	[ ] Ensure that init properties are copied over when clear is done
    [ ] init w h renderer (which serves as a replacement to size(w,h,renderer))
    	[ ] prevent size() from being called directly
    	[ ] allow init to be called again, it signifying starting completely from scratch
    	[ ] allow 3 types of calls:
    		[ ] init
    		[ ] init w h
    		[ ] init w h renderer
    [ ] reinit w h renderer (which is effectively like making the sketch larger in size 
    	without changing any of the already existing commands)
    	[ ] allow 3 types of calls:
    		[ ] reinit
    		[ ] reinit w h
    		[ ] reinit w h renderer    	
	[ ] undo x (undo the last x non-undo/redo statements)
	[ ] redo x (redo the last y undos, y = min(x,k), k=no. of continuous undos before this redo
    [ ] print (adds all correct commands executed from the last clear into an repl() function at 
        the bottom of the current sketch)
[ ] Add in more complex constructs, like variable declarations, ifs and loops
[ ] Allow import statements

Bugs
====
[ ] Uncaught exceptions (probably, even hopefully) run amok
[ ] REPL sketch sometimes just doesn't open, especially just after PDE is started

Internals
=========
[ ] Have errors checked line-by-line
[ ] Hot-swap without re-opening new sketches
[ ] Delete temporary folder used by REPL Mode on exit

Readme
======
[ ] Add build instructions
[ ] Add usage instructions

Code Style
==========
[ ] Check out how enter and delete keys are handled in CommandPromptPane class
[ ] Check out where best to handle the `clear` command actually clearing the console

Done
----

UI
==
[X] Get enter key to run whole command, not break it up
[X] Close REPL sketch when PDE is closed
[X] Get up and down to cycle through the commands
[X] Replace ">> " with "...  " when user enters an incomplete command (Eg: With a '{' or ',' at the end)
[X] Give REPL Console focus when REPL tab is clicked
[X] Get the REPL prompt to have a, well, prompt-like feel

Build
=====
[X] Make things compatible with 3.0
