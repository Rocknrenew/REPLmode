Todo
----

UI
==
[ ] Get enter key to run whole command, not break it up
[ ] Close REPL sketch when PDE is closed
[ ] Give REPL Mode focus, not skecth, when sketch is run
[ ] Add colorization
[ ] Update font as soon as user changes it in Preferences window

Usage
=====
[ ] Add in simple drawing functions
[ ] Add in miscellaneous command words specific to REPL Mode:
        [ ] clear
        	[ ] Ensure that init properties are copied over when clear is done
        [ ] init x y (which serves as a replacement to size(x,y))
        	[ ] prevent size() from being called directly
        	[ ] allow init to be called again, the only change being that size of sketch is different
	[ ] undo x (undo the last x non-undo/redo statements)
	[ ] redo x (redo the last y undos, y = min(x,k), k=no. of continuous undos before this redo
        [ ] print (adds all correct commands executed from the last clear into an repl() function at 
            the bottom of the current sketch)
[ ] Add in more complex constructs, like variable declarations, ifs and loops

Bugs
====
[ ] Uncaught exceptions (probably, even hopefully) run amok
[ ] REPL sketch sometimes just doesn't open

Internals
=========
[ ] Have errors checked line-by-line
[ ] Hot-swap without re-opening new sketches

Readme
======
[ ] Add build instructions
[ ] Add usage instructions

Code Style
==========
[ ] Check out how enter and delete keys are handled in CommandPromptPane class
[ ] Check out where best to handle the `clear` command actually clearing the console

[X] Get up and down to cycle through the commands
[X] Replace ">> " with "...  " when user enters an incomplete command (Eg: With a '{' or ',' at the end)
[X] Give REPL Console focus when REPL tab is clicked
[X] Get the REPL prompt to have a, well, prompt-like feel

Build
